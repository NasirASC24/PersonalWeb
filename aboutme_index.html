    <p>Hi, my name is Nasir Watkins. I am currently a rising junior and a cinematic arts major at Douglas Anderson school of the Arts.
        I am very interested in a lot of things. So many in fact, that I can't choose what to do. I feel that there are so many great options
        and it's too hard too choose. So, to solve this I try new things to see what I like and what I don't like. This system has been working
        to an extent so far, but a downside is that when I find things that I like, I have to do those things less in order to try new things.
        Something new I'm currently trying is learning how to code. It's been all right, a little frustating at times, but like most things, 
        I'm managing to get through it pretty well. In all, I just want to try as much I can and eventually find something(s) that are sustainable,
        and make it work. 
    </p>
