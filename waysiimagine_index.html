    <h1>THE POWER OF IMAGINATION</h1>
    <p>I have an imagination. There are quite a few ways I express this. Such as through cinema, visual art, epic battles in my head, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nasirwatkins3418" target="_blank">my youtube channel</a> (for the cringe things),
        crafting with cardboard, etc. I do these things so that I have a creative and innovative output. By doing this I don't let my valuable ideas go to waste. Everyone has ideas, but not everyone is willing to make them a reality. 
        So it's important to strive for whatever it is you want to do, and make that dream come true.
